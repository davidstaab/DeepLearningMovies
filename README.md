Kaggle's competition for using Google's word2vec package for sentiment analysis

## Personal Learning Project
This fork is just meant to be a sandbox where I can learn how Word2Vec's API works and play with it to my satisfaction.
It's not meant to be reused and offers no license beyond the one it inherits from the upstream repo.

## Installation

There're some requirements for making the stuff work. Use `pip` to install them easily:

```bash
$> sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
